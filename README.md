# Sampling Assignment

## Objective
To study the effect of different sampling techniques on machine learning model performance for an imbalanced credit card dataset.

## Dataset
Creditcard_data.csv  
Original class distribution:
Class 0: 763  
Class 1: 9  

## Sampling Techniques Used
1. Random Under Sampling  
2. Random Over Sampling  
3. SMOTE  
4. ADASYN  
5. SMOTEENN  

## Models Used
M1 - Logistic Regression  
M2 - Decision Tree  
M3 - Random Forest  
M4 - Support Vector Machine  
M5 - Gradient Boosting  

## Results

## Conclusion
SMOTEENN sampling provided the best overall performance across all models by generating synthetic minority samples and removing noisy majority samples.
